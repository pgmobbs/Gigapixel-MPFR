The code in Control_box_1.5.ino is intended for use with an Arduino Mega equipped with one or more EasyDriver stepping motor control boards. The code provides for up to 5 motors with a view to being able to move a camera/macro specimens in X,Y and Z planes to create Z stacks the results of which can be stitched to produce gigapixel photographs. The A and B axes are intended for use in the creation of stereo photographs, 3d movies and product photography. The project is in progress and it is likely that the code will change over time. At present it is functional for Z stacking using a mostly 3d printed rail. The 3d printed rail components will be made available at thingiverse.com. The progress of the project will be described on petermobbs.wordpress.com. 
29/11/21: A new version of the software has been uploaded: https://github.com/pgmobbs/Gigapixel-MPFR/blob/master/Control_box_extended_3_in_use.ino and the parts are now available on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5146275. Descriptions of the project can be found at https://petermobbs.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/a-mostly-printed-focus-rail-the-gigapixel-project-part-3/ https://petermobbs.wordpress.com/2020/02/17/a-mostly-printed-focus-rail-the-gigapixel-project-part-2/ and https://petermobbs.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/a-mostly-printed-focus-rail-part-1/
The author cannot offer assistance with the construction of the XYZ rails beyond that offered at the links above.
